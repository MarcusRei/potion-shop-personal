This is a personal version of a group project called The Potion Shop. This one is made because the original one is archived and can be found [here!](https://github.com/MarcusRei/grupp-8-potion-shop)

A lot of the original images and assets have been stripped out because of weird rendering issues. If you want all the amazing art created by [Carolina](https://github.com/Carowa27) you should go see the original.

## Goal
The goal was to create the frontend for a e-commerce site of our own choosing.
